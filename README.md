# Advent of Code 2022

Working through solutions, slowly, in Rust.
Inspired by this post [Learning Rust with ChatGPT, Copilot and Advent of Code](https://simonwillison.net/2022/Dec/5/rust-chatgpt-copilot/)  ([github](https://github.com/simonw/advent-of-code-2022-in-rust)).

Ultimately, I'm trying to use chatGPT as a jumping off point - as problems become complex I'm notice more errors.
I've haven't fed the AI any direct input from the problem description, but rather trying to
formulate my interpretation of the problem and generate help code snippets, instead of going to Google or StackOverflow for help.

The Rust compiler debugger is doing the rest!
